ruleName: no-null-undefined-union
description: |-

  Disallows explicitly declared or implicitly returned union types with both `null` and
  `undefined` as members.
          
rationale: |-

  A union type that includes both `null` and `undefined` is either redundant or fragile.
  Enforcing the choice between the two allows the `triple-equals` rule to exist without
  exceptions, and is essentially a more flexible version of the `no-null-keyword` rule.
  Optional parameters are not considered to have the type `undefined`.
