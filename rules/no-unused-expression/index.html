ruleName: no-unused-expression
description: Disallows unused expression statements.
descriptionDetails: |-

  Unused expressions are expression statements which are not assignments or function calls
  (and thus usually no-ops).
rationale: |-

  Detects potential errors where an assignment or function call was intended. Also detects constructs such as
  `new SomeClass()`, where a constructor is used solely for its side effects, which is considered poor style.
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
type: functionality
optionsJSON: 'null'
layout: rule
