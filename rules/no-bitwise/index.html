ruleName: "no-bitwise"
description: Disallows bitwise operators.
descriptionDetails: "\nSpecifically, the following bitwise operators are banned:\n`&`, `&=`, `|`, `|=`,\n`^`, `^=`, `<<`, `<<=`,\n`>>`, `>>=`, `>>>`, `>>>=`, and `~`.\nThis rule does not ban the use of `&` and `|` for intersection and union types."
rationale: "\nBitwise operators are often typos - for example `bool1 & bool2` instead of `bool1 && bool2`.\nThey also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability."
