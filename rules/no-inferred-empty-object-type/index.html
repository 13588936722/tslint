ruleName: no-inferred-empty-object-type
description: 'Disallow type inference of {} (empty object type) at function and constructor call sites'
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  Prior to TypeScript 3.4, generic type parameters for functions and constructors are inferred as
  `{}` (the empty object type) by default when no type parameter is explicitly supplied or when
  the compiler cannot infer a more specific type.
  This is often undesirable as the call is meant to be of a more specific type.
