ruleName: curly
description: "Enforces braces for `if`/`for`/`do`/`while` statements."
rationale: "\n```ts\nif (foo === bar)\n    foo++;\n    bar++;\n```\n\nIn the code above, the author almost certainly meant for both `foo++` and `bar++`\nto be executed only if `foo === bar`. However, he forgot braces and `bar++` will be executed\nno matter what. This rule could prevent such a mistake."
