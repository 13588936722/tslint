ruleName: curly
description: Enforces braces for `if`/`for`/`do`/`while` statements.
rationale: |-

  ```ts
  if (foo === bar)
      foo++;
      bar++;
  ```

  In the code above, the author almost certainly meant for both `foo++` and `bar++`
  to be executed only if `foo === bar`. However, he forgot braces and `bar++` will be executed
  no matter what. This rule could prevent such a mistake.
optionsDescription: |-

  The rule may be set to `true`, or to the following:

  * `"ignore-same-line"` skips checking braces for control-flow statements
  that are on one line and start on the same line as their control-flow keyword
          
options:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ignore-same-line
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "ignore-same-line"]'
