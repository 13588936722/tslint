ruleName: "no-switch-case-fall-through"
description: "\nDisallows falling through case statements.\n\nFor example, the following is not allowed:\n\n```ts\nswitch(foo) {\n    case 1:\n        someFunc(foo);\n    case 2:\n        someOtherFunc(foo);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, fall through is allowed when case statements are consecutive or\na magic `/* falls through */` comment is present. The following is valid:\n\n```ts\nswitch(foo) {\n    case 1:\n        someFunc(foo);\n        /* falls through */\n    case 2:\n    case 3:\n        someOtherFunc(foo);\n}\n```"
rationale: Fall though in switch statements is often unintentional and a bug.
