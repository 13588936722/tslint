description: "Disallows access to the constructors of `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean`."
descriptionDetails: "Disallows constructor use such as `new Number(foo)` but does not disallow `Number(foo)`."
rationale: "\nThere is little reason to use `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean` as constructors.\nIn almost all cases, the regular function-call version is more appropriate.\n[More details](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4719320/3124288) are available on StackOverflow."
