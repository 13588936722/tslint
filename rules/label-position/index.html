ruleName: "label-position"
description: Only allows labels in sensible locations.
descriptionDetails: "This rule only allows labels to be on `do/for/while/switch` statements."
rationale: "\nLabels in JavaScript only can be used in conjunction with `break` or `continue`,\nconstructs meant to be used for loop flow control. While you can theoretically use\nlabels on any block statement in JS, it is considered poor code structure to do so."
